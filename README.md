## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

This project was relatively simple, it took longer to measure, as they have to be as faithful to the design as possible.
Probably the code is not the best of optimization but I accept suggestions.

In this project, I improved my skills with grids, discovered new approaches with JavaScript, and wrote more readable code.
